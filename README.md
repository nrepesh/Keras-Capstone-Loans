# Keras-Capstone-Loans

I used Keras and Tensorflow to predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan?
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we built a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

I used Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization. I clearned missing data and implemented feature engineering.
Finally, I evaluated the results using a confusion matrix and classification report.
